# 📝 Problem Statement
# Given two sorted linked lists list1 and list2, merge them into a single sorted linked list and return the head of the merged list.
#
# 📌 Example
# Input:
# list1: 1 → 2 → 4
# list2: 1 → 3 → 4
#
# Output:
# 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 4
#
# 🧠 Concept
# You use a dummy node to simplify logic.
# At each step, pick the smaller value from list1 or list2, and build the new list.

print('hello1')
